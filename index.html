            <h2> INTRODUCTION </h2><br><br> 
            <p>First of all, thank you for giving me 
this opportunity to introduce myself.<br><br><br><br>
“Hi, My name is RITIK KUMAR. <br><br>
​Currently i m persuing btech cse from nshm k c.
Also, I did my 12th & 10th from CBSE Board in the year 2016 
and 2014 respectively.<br><br><br><br>
 Considering 
 my family background details – we’re 4 members in the family.
 Apart from my parents, I have a sibling – a Younger brother.<br><br>

//I am good in programming languages C,  and python .<br><br>

To be honest, my short-term goal is to get a job in a 
reputed company like Accenture where
 I can use my skills and knowledge to 
deliver value-added result and in long term, the goal 
would be to achieve a good position in your 
organization’s .<br><br> Other than that, if I talk about my
 strengths – I can say that I’m a quick learner, team player,
 adaptable and creative person – and my weakness is "<br><br>
 I am a straightforward
 person, and I cannot say no when someone asks me for help.and "Sometimes, I don't 
 have a very good attention to detail. While that's good because it lets me
execute quickly, it also means that I sometimes make careless mistakes. Because of that,
 <br><br>I make
sure to always have someone else double check my work." "

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family,
 reading, playing outdoor sports, and sometimes cooking.<br><br>

That’s all about me. <br><br>And yes, thanks for the opportunity 
given to introduce myself!”</p>
